# PublicHandler, a nbviewer service for jupyterhub

This code adds nbviewer-like functionality, via a JupyterHub Service, to a jupyterhub installation. 
That is, it allows users to "publish" their notebooks so that they can be seen as HTML.

See also the Javascript nbextension for copying notebooks to a user's public_html folder.
